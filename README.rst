Overview
--------

Some of the services which provide RSS channels let you use this way to read the entire content. See for example http://www.osnews.com/. Most of the providers however show you only 'demos' of the news which consist of very brief descriptions. If you are interested in the exact content, you need to navigate to their webpage. See for example http://www.sciencedaily.com/.

When it comes to RSS readers they are usually either lightweight and limit you to see only the content of RSS channels, or they allow you to see the webpages as well, but for that they integrate web browsers and become heavyweight.

FRSS is a minimalistic RSS reader which combines both properties. It is lightweight, works in command line and at the same time lets you read the full text without opening the browser.
